Firmware for ESP8266/ESP8285 and ESP32 (original, pico, S2, S3, C3) used with 3D printer/Sand-Table and CNC 

To compile ESP3D you need to edit the configuration.h according your needs.   
You can also generate it, using [![Development  Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ESP3D-Configurator-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=preact)](https://luc-github.github.io/) which simplify a lot this step.
